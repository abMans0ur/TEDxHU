                TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers
                and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at
                <a href="https://www.ted.com/" style="color: black" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TED.com</a
          >. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth
          Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi
          Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman. <br /><br />
          The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver,
          British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new
          TED Talks are posted daily; TED Translators, which provides subtitles
          and interactive transcripts as well as translations from volunteers
          worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established The
          Audacious Project that takes a collaborative approach to funding ideas
          with the potential to create change at thrilling scale; TEDx, which
          supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized
          TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program,
          helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the
          impact of their remarkable projects and activities.

          In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program
          called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that
          bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is
          called TEDx[name], where x = independently organized TED event. At our
          TEDx[name] event, TED Talks video and live speakers will combine to
          spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED
          Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but
          individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.
